# Seating Arrangement App

Application to set tables for a wedding using React on the front-end, Django + Channels in the back-end to handle asynchronous, computation heavy tasks, Redis as a message broker and Simulated Annealing algorithm to solve the NP-hard problem.
<br /><br />

A good next step would be to clean up the code and add an interface for the user to create relationships, which would be sent to the backend and processed into a relationship matrix. A nicer interface wouldn't hurt either.
